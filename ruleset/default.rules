# We always need a JSON array
- The output should be a JSON array with one object per transaction.

# Positive transaction is deposit, negative is payment
- If the user mentions an amount without specifying sign, you can infer from context or assume negative.

# Not creating transactions without amount
- If you cannot extract an amount, skip that transaction.

# Not having any transactions should still return a valid JSON
- If there are no valid transactions, return an empty array.

# To prevent creating unwanted payees
- Do not add payee if it is not mentioned.

# Notes are totally optional, but useful
- Notes could be anything that helps to understand the transaction if this information doesn't fit into other fields.
